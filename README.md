# 🎛️ AudioBook Downloader

## 📌 Overview

🔹 I was taking a break from my review and I wanted to get some general cleaning as well.  
🔹 Listening to an audiobook while cleaining would make me productive.  
🔹 However, I felt lazy to manually download each .mp3 file of my choosen book.  
🔹 So I automated the download of .mp3 files from a website.

### **Project Goal:**

🏗️ Develop a Python Script to download .mp3 files from a webiste.

### **Tools Used:**

🐍 **Python** (Request, BeautifulSoup)

### **Target Website:**

🤫 secret hahaha.

## 🔍 Key Insights

🔹 **BeautifulSoup:** Parsing HTML data from the web to find the source of the .mp3 files.  
🔹 **Request:** Verified that the transaction between my local pc and website server was "OK". ( HTTP status code 200)  

## 📊 Project Files

- 🐍 **Python Script:** [Download Python Script](https://github.com/RemyRoams/AudioBook-Downloader/blob/main/AudioBooks_Download.py)

## 🚀 Future Improvements

✅ **Adapt** the script to function for different websites, It only works the specific site where I get my audiobooks.

This project is an **application of python**, automating a tredious task of **downloading a file**, through parsing html data and locating its source from a website.
